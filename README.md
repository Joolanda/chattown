# Chattown â€“ a React Native chat app

A chat app for mobile devices using React Native, Expo, Google's Firebase/Firestore and gifted-chat library.
The app will provide users with a chat interface and the possibility to share images (take a picture or choose from media library) and their location with others.

##### Key Features
- Select background color before starting a chat
- Ask for permission to use location data and share images
- take a new picture or choose one from your media library
- Datastorage online in firebase Cloud and local storage offline

### Getting started
First you need to set up your development environment. Make sure you have the latest version of [Node]https://nodejs.org/en/ and install [Expo]https://expo.io/
```sh
$ npm install expo-cli --global
 ```
For testing the app you can use XCode as an iOS Simulator or [Android-Studio]https://developer.android.com/studio emulator. You will need Expo to run the app on your mobile device (iOS/Android Smartphone) or use the emulator (or simulator). Download the Expo app from App or Play store onto your device.
Create [your-Expo-account] https://expo.io/signup.

Now you can set up your React Native App! Make sure you are working in your projects folder.
```sh
$ expo init hello-world
```
Back in your terminal choose the blank template - but not the TypeScript blank

Go to your project's directory using cd project-name and start with npm start or expo start. This will launch the https server "Metro Bundler in a new tab. You can also hit the in terminal "?" to see all options for running the app. 

Nice work!

### Setting up your Database
Storage of realtime conversations in the Firestore Database. With [Firebase]https://firebase.google.com/docs you can authenticate the users anonymously 

```sh
$ npm install --save firebase@7.9.0
```
